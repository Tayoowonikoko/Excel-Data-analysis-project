# 🍏 Apple Inc. R&D and Performance Analysis  

## 🔹 Business Problem  
Research & Development (R&D) is a key driver of innovation and growth in the technology sector. This project explores how Apple’s R&D investments have impacted its **financial performance and revenue between 2015–2024**. The ultimate goal was to determine whether Apple’s financial trajectory makes it a **worthwhile investment opportunity**.

## 🔹 Dataset  
- **Source**: Apple Inc. Annual Reports (2015–2024)  
- **Variables analyzed**:  
  - Return on Assets (ROA)  
  - Return on Equity (ROE)  
  - Return on Investment (ROI)  
  - Earnings Per Share (EPS)  
  - Revenue  
  - R&D Expenditure  

---

## 🔹 Approach  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Collected financial data from Apple’s official annual reports (2015–2024).  
- Standardized variables and structured data into tables.  
- Cleaned for consistency and formatted for statistical analysis.  

### 2. Descriptive Analysis  
- Calculated mean, min, max, and skewness for each financial metric.  
- Plotted trends for:  
  - **Revenue growth (2015–2024)**  
  - **R&D expenditure growth (2015–2024)**  
  - **EPS trend (2015–2024)**  
  - **ROA, ROE, and ROI combined (2015–2024)**  

### 3. Correlation Analysis  
Correlation results between R&D and key metrics:  

| Variable        | Correlation Coefficient |  
|-----------------|--------------------------|  
| Revenue         | 0.95 |  
| ROA (%)         | 0.86 |  
| ROE (%)         | 0.92 |  
| ROI (%)         | 0.93 |  
| EPS (thousands) | -0.56 |  

- R&D is strongly correlated with revenue, ROA, ROE, and ROI.  
- EPS has a moderate negative correlation, partly due to share buybacks and stock market fluctuations.  

### 4. Regression Analysis  
- **Performance Model**: R&D explains **85% of performance variation** (R² = 0.85).  
- **Revenue Model**: R&D explains **90% of revenue variation** (R² = 0.90).  
- Both models statistically significant (p < 0.05).

## 🔹 Key Insights  
- **R&D spending grew from $8B (2015) to $31B (2024)**, showing Apple’s long-term commitment to innovation.  
- **Revenue trend**: steady growth, peaking near $394B in 2022, slight dip in 2023, then recovery in 2024.  
- **Profitability metrics**:  
  - ROA and ROE consistently improved as R&D increased.  
  - ROI peaked at **66.7% in 2022**, sustaining strong levels into 2024.  
- **Correlation evidence**: R&D is a strong driver of revenue and performance.  
- **Investor view**: despite EPS volatility, Apple remains fundamentally strong with R&D as a backbone of growth.
